Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

    Reporting a bug
    Discussing the current state of the code
    Submitting a fix
    Proposing new features
    Becoming a maintainer

We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

    Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
    If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
    If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
    Ensure the test suite passes.
    Make sure your code lints.
    Issue that pull request!

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Enjoy :-)
